Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
A searching program specifically tailored towards the law system that can aid and help paralegals and lawyers in their research for cases. The learners will specifically target law terminalogy as well as to its best ability understand the context of the sentences rather than just separate words. The user would enter in a fil, in which the learner will come up with a results of related information it can spot that relates to every part of the file that the user can then interpret and utitlise for their research and work.
## Background
* This idea will solve the time it takes in researching as it will aid the users in their researching time. It saves a lot of time which is important because lawyers and paralegals would have deadlines and a lot of stress in time management in their line of work. This is a common problem in most areas of professional work, not just in law. If I was to have such a system as a lawyer, I know I would benefit immensely with a learner that can guide me with my research better than a all-purpose assistant such as Alexa or Siri which both are not specifically programmed for law.

* Having a law learner will improve human performance in work as well as productivity. There are many factors which affect human performance such as diet, sleep, routine. All these factors differ with different users at varying levels. However, a learner can minimise stress and improve productivity as well as efficiency as it's computerised. Information can easily be misinterpreted or overlooked, so this minimises human error when researching and finding related information.
* User motivation. This line of work can be extremely tedious as it is let alone the researching part. Research and reading is commonly known to be the most 'boring' task and this can impact all staff' motivation. Knowing there's a process that can guide this will instantly be a relief for a lot of users knowing that they can get onto applying their work more.
* In theory, if research was done faster, there would be an increase of cases completed or at least progressing much faster. This doesn't just help firms, governments and businesses but also the people affected with such cases. Justice is more reachabple and given quicker to people whether it's in corporate or the criminal justice system. This gives hope to a lot more people as cases are known to be extremely long and time consuming.

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* problem 1
* problem 2
* etc.
## How is it used?
Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?
Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)
If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">
This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]
   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)
   # write your solution here
   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%
main()
```
## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)
| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
